## Data
Our data is based on Harvard Dataverse which scrapped the transcript on CNN broadcast available online between the years of 2000-2022.

## Our project 
We focused on the news broadcast around major events in the US to examine the different shifts that the news takes during and after these 
events that shape and impact the nation. We will examine the main topics discussed in news broadcasts by analyzing the words spoken in each broadcast.
We chose five major events between those years to examine and analyze:
1. 9/11 terror attack 
2. Invading Iraq March 2003 
3. Hurricane Katrina in August 23-31, 2005 
4. Killing of Bin Laden May 2011 
5. Bombing at Boston Marathon at April 15, 2013
