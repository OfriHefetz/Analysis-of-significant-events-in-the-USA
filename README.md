Authors: Ofri Hefetz, Shai Shani Bar and Gony Idan


## General
This repository contains our final project in the course "Psychological and Cognitive Networks" taught at Technion University.


## Project parts
1. Gathering information & general description of the continuation of the project
2. Setting up network analysis & visualization
3. construction of the networks,  analysis, & conclusions


## Data
Harvard Dataverse which scrapped the transcript on CNN broadcast available online between the years of 2000-2022.

## Our project 
We focused on the news broadcast around major events in the US to examine the different shifts that the news takes during and after these 
events that shape and impact the nation. We will examine the main topics discussed in news broadcasts by analyzing the words spoken in each broadcast.
We chose five major events between those years to examine and analyze:
1. 9/11 terror attack 
2. Invading Iraq March 2003 
3. Hurricane Katrina in August 23-31, 2005 
4. Killing of Bin Laden May 2011 
5. Bombing at Boston Marathon at April 15, 2013 


## Visualization
In our project we provide a simple and convinent way to represent all the graphs and metrics generated in the different parts. By running the file 'create_dash.py' you would generate and interactive dashboard that should be open on Chrome browser. This dashboard will allow you to examine the different graphs for the events through out time, examine the different degree centrality of the nodes and the communities genearted for each day. Make sure before running the code you save the needed data files, data_git/graphs, data_git/centrality and data_git/nodes, in the relevent location and update code accordingly. 

Enjoy!
